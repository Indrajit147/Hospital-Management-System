# Hospital-Management-System
As a 2nd-semester student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), I'm thrilled to present my project for CSE 1209: Hospital Management System.

This project involved designing a system in C that streamlines patient management, patient records and file management. I also explored key programming concepts like the use of all types of loops, switch cases, call by reference, call by value, and pointers, making the system both efficient and flexible. It was an incredible learning experience that enhanced my problem-solving and coding skills.
